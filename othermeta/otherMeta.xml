    <p>The SalesForce input document corpus consists of 44K <xref scope="external" format="html" href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/os/part2-tech-content/dita-v1.3-os-part2-tech-content.html">Dita</xref> topics and bookmaps.</p>

    <p>We would like to migrate the <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/>
    data, currently replicated in each topic, into the calling bookmaps in the
    expectation that this will eliminate a lot of boiler plate code.</p>

    <p>We assume that <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> will <b>only</b>
    be applied in the metadata section of bookmaps.</p>

    <p><abbreviated-form keyref="xref"/> has been upgraded to track and report
    <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> in its input corpus.</p>

    <p>The results of applying <abbreviated-form keyref="xref"/> to the full input corpus are visible at:
    <filepath>s3://salesforce.dita/results2/</filepath> </p>

    <p>To check that
    the processing performed by <abbreviated-form keyref="xref"/> is correct, 4
    documents have been produced that demonstrate the various <abbreviated-form
    keyref="othermeta"/> possibilities and the resulting <abbreviated-form
    keyref="xref"/> reports. The input documents can be seen in
    <filepath>doc/</filepath>, the corresponding reports are in the
    <filepath>reports/other_meta/</filepath> folder of the accompanying
    <abbreviated-form keyref="zip"/> file.</p>

    <p>In the test cases we have 5 <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> names:
      <dl>
        <dlentry><dt>aa</dt><dd>AAAA</dd></dlentry>
        <dlentry><dt>bb</dt><dd>BBBB</dd></dlentry>
        <dlentry><dt>cc</dt><dd>CCCC</dd></dlentry>
        <dlentry><dt>dd</dt><dd>DD11</dd><dd>DD22</dd></dlentry>
        <dlentry><dt>ee</dt><dd>EEEE</dd><dd>EEee</dd></dlentry>
      </dl>

      </p>

    <p><abbreviated-form keyref="xref"/> produces the following reports when
    applied to an input corpus:</p>

    <dl>
      <dlentry>

        <dt>duplicates_separately</dt> <dd>Duplicated <abbreviated-form
        keyref="othermeta"/> names in bookmaps and topics considered
        separately. This report is not present as in this scenario as there are
        no duplicated <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> in either the book
        maps or the topics as can be seen by inspecting the topic files. </dd>

      </dlentry>

      <dlentry>
        <dt>duplicates</dt> <dd>Duplicated <abbreviated-form
        keyref="othermeta"/> names in bookmaps with the <abbreviated-form
        keyref="othermeta"/> from their called topics included</dd>
      </dlentry>

      <dlentry>
        <dt>must_remain_in_topic</dt> <dd><abbreviated-form
        keyref="othermeta"/> that must currently stay in the called topic
        because pushing it into the calling bookmap would cause
        <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> name duplication</dd>
      </dlentry>

      <dlentry>
        <dt>push_to_book_maps</dt> <dd><abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/>
        that can currently be safely pushed to the calling book map without
        causing <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> name duplication</dd>
      </dlentry>

      <dlentry>
        <dt>book_maps_before_topics_included</dt> <dd>Bookmap <abbreviated-form
        keyref="othermeta"/> before topic <abbreviated-form
        keyref="othermeta"/> has been included</dd>
      </dlentry>

      <dlentry>
        <dt>book_maps_after_topics_included</dt>
        <dd>Bookmap <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> after topic <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> data has been included</dd>
      </dlentry>
    </dl>

    <p>Probably the most useful report is
      <filepath>duplicates</filepath> which shows which <abbreviated-form
      keyref="othermeta"/> names would have duplicate definitions in each
      bookmap if the <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> currently in each
      topic was migrated to its calling bookmaps.  If these topics were
      deduplicated then their <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> data could
      be safely transferred from each topic to the calling bookmaps without
      fear of contention.
    </p>

    <p>The purpose of each report is discussed in the following sections with
    additional notes relating the report to the test scenario:</p>

    <section>
      <title>duplicates_separately</title> <p>This report lists the bookmaps or
      topics that have duplicated <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> names
      in them.  I.e. the same name is defined with different contents.
      Obviously this confusion of purpose is undesirable. A first step then
      would be to reduce this report to zero by resolving the duplication
      of <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> names in any items listed in
      it.</p>

      <note>In the test scenario no bookmaps or topics have duplicated
      <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> names and so this report is not present.</note>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>duplicates</title>

      <p>This report lists the bookmaps that have bookmaps that call topics
      that require different values for a given <abbreviated-form
      keyref="othermeta"/> name.  We wish to reduce this report to zero.</p>

      <note>In the test scenario the <b>dd</b> and <b>ee</b> <abbreviated-form
      keyref="othermeta"/> are problematic because they either disagree with
      what is already in the bookmaps or with items that will be pushed into
      the bookmaps by other topics called from the bookmaps.</note>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>must_remain_in_topic</title>

      <p>This report lists <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> that
      currently must remain in their topics because, currently, moving the
      indicated <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> to the calling bookmap
      would cause <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> name duplication in
      that bookmap. Consequently we wish to reduce this report to zero.</p>

      <note>In the test scenario the <b>dd</b> and <b>ee</b> <abbreviated-form
      keyref="othermeta"/> must currently remain in their respective topics
      because of the disagreements noted in the previous section.</note>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>push_to_book_maps</title> <p>This report lists the
      <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> that can currently be safely moved
      to their calling bookmaps with causing duplication.  We wish to maximize
      this report!</p>

      <note>In the test scenario the <b>aa</b>, <b>bb</b> and <b>cc</b>
      <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> can be safely migrated to the
      their calling bookmaps as there are no clashes withe either the
      <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> currently in each bookmap or with
      the requirements of the other topics called from each bookmap.</note>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>book_maps_before_topics_included</title> <p>This report lists the
      status quo apriori - the <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> items in
      each file before any deduplication.  The report:
      <filepath>duplicates_separately</filepath>
       is a reduction of this report which shows only the duplicated items.
       </p>

      <note>In the test scenario the <b>aa</b>, <b>bb</b> and <b>ee</b>
      <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> are already included in one or
      other of the bookmaps. </note>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>book_maps_after_topics_included</title>
      <p>
        This report lists the outcome of moving all the <abbreviated-form
        keyref="othermeta"/> items to their calling bookmaps regardless of any
        duplication.  The report <filepath>duplicates</filepath> is a reduction
        of this report to show only the duplicated <abbreviated-form
        keyref="othermeta"/> items.

        <note>In the test scenario all of the <abbreviated-form
        keyref="othermeta"/> are visible in the report with the <b>dd</b>,
        <b>ee</b> <abbreviated-form keyref="othermeta"/> duplicated. </note>
